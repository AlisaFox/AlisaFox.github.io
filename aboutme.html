                    Hey there! I'm Alisa, a second year student in Mcgill University majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Cognitive Science. 
              I love exploring different areas of the digital world and learning how to apply them to the real world.  
              I've often been described as inventive, rational, and determined, with a practical approach to life. 
      </p>
      <p  style="margin-left: 40px">
             Outside of school, I am a very sporty person. I've done dancing, taekwondo, karate, swimming, yoga, and weight-lifting. I've been swimming since I was 8, so due to all that
        experience, I started working a swim instructor with both kids and adults once I was 16. 
      </p>
        <p  style="margin-left: 40px">
             My hobbies are ever changing. I've gone from knitting and making friendship bracelets to animating with Blender and playing with Arduino.  Back in high school,
          I took drama, arts, and music (instead of sticking with one like most people do) due to my inquistive nature. 
          However, I pledge that, I will always love cats, good food, coffee, and sleep. 
      </p>

           Click on projects if you want to see some of my work. Fair warning, I am still a noob at most things. But hey, welcome to my website and it's nice to see you here!
