          I have a bit of experience developing websites like this. From finding
          colour palletes to making fun js scripts like this, every part of it
          is tons of fun!
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, javascript was the first language I learned back when I was
          14. Here is
          <a href="https://perfect-birth.glitch.me/" target="_blank"
            >another website</a
          >
          that I made and use to this day.

          A majority of my more complicated projects were built in C. For
          example, I've made a "<a
            href="https://github.com/AlisaFox/C-projects/tree/master/TinyShell"
            target="_blank"
            >tiny shell</a
          >" that is a simplified version of a bash terminal. It also has unique commands like <i>history</i>, which would show the last 100
          user prompts; or <i>limit </i>
          which would limit the amount of memory the pseudo-shell would be
          allowed to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another one of my projects was a
          <a
            href="https://github.com/AlisaFox/C-projects/tree/master/SimpleFileSystem"
            target="_blank"
          >
            simple file system</a
          >. It mostly involved two parts: organizing the simulated disk into
          components like the superblock and inodes. Then the next part was
          making functions to make files, write and read from them, and so on.
          Because this is a simplefied file system, making subdirectories is not
          yet supported.

          Java is the language I am familiar with the most. I've made a lot of
          small projects. Some of them are games: like
          <a
            href="https://github.com/AlisaFox/Java/tree/master/tictactoe"
            target="_blank"
            >tic-tac-toe</a
          >
          against a bot with a twist, the board size was specified by the user.
          So if you ever wanted to know what it is like to play tic-tac-toe on a
          10 by 10 board, now you can!
        </p>
        <p>
          In this
          <a
            href="https://github.com/AlisaFox/Java/tree/master/warehouse"
            target="_blank"
            >warehouse representation</a
          >
          I delved into the object-oriented aspect of java. There are boxes of
          different sizes, that have to fit on shelves in a warehouse in an
          optimal way. I used the merge-sort algorithm, to reorganize the boxes
          and the shelves according to their heights. I have also played with
          classes a bit, for example <i> urgent box </i> is a subclass of box,
          which can be added to a separate shipping list so that it leaves the
          warehouse faster.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a
            href="https://github.com/AlisaFox/Java/tree/master/hotel"
            target="_blank"
            >Here</a
          >
          is another representation, this time of an hotel booking system. You
          can see how many rooms there are available, book one, get your bill,
          and so on.

          I have recently started delving into Machine Learning. I am currently
          learning how to use Tensor Flow, and all the things that need to be
          considered when you make a database. No examples to show just yet,
          check back in a month or two!

          I am familiar with a lot of different languages: from the safety-based
          OCaml, to the assembly MIPS, to the reflective list based LISP.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, coding is not the only thing that I am passionate about. I
          love dancing, my favourite styles being contemporary and jazz. I have
          also recently started learning how to play the acoustic guitar. I love crafting
          things with my hands, so I'm currently playing around with wire work.
