# Alisagagina.github.io

## What:
This is my [personal website!](https://alisagagina.github.io/)

## What's happening right now?
Currently I have one page for everything. In landscape it is split 50:50, in portrait mode every section has a width of 100%.
The sections are as follows: cover, menu & links, about me, pic of me, personal projects, school projects.
I went from multiple pages to one for easier styling, maybe I will go back to the older method.


### Old version
This website is ever-evolving: there once were three pages (index, about me, projects). 
You should probably see it first to understand what I am talking about from here.

Index is the pretty page: it has my name, and links to this github and my insta (since I don't use FB much)

Projects is the fun page: I have a pretty interesting JavaScript running there. I did get the basics of it from this [thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10385950/how-to-get-a-div-to-randomly-move-around-a-page-using-jquery-or-css). Not only do
my project topics move around, once you click on them an overlay turns on.

About me is the obligatory page: It is also the page that inspired my current colour scheme (see pic).

## To-do list: 

#### New:
- Make the text flow better
- Check if widescreen dimensions work well
  - In particular, find a better way to adapt font size to page size.


#### Old:
- ~~I need to impove the js part~~ (ignoring since I won't be using this)
  - Improve the stop button: instead of finishing moving to it's current destination, I need to cut the journey of the object short.
  - Make the script shorter: there are some redundant parts, for example when I init.
  - Make the starting point random for every object:
    - They all start at the top right corner
    - However they are also programmed not to go out of bounds by calucalting the bounds from their initial spot (i.e. (0,0))
    - Have a predetermined first location at diferrent speeds for every object? so fast that the human eye can't see?
- ~~Change the projects page to be less intrusive and in your face~~ (done via new format)
  - ~~Probably by making a normal version with paragraphs, with a big link saying "here is the fun version of the same page"~~
- ~~About me page~~ (done!)
  - ~~I do not like the way the image of me shrinks into the top-right corner when you change the size of the page.~~
    - ~~More precisely when your browser screen is approximately square in size.~~
    - ~~Maybe use bootstrap for this part?~~
  - Make the words flow better
