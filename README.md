# AlisaFox.github.io

## What:
This is my [personal website!](AlisaFox.github.io)

## What's happening right now?
This website is ever-evolving: there are three pages at the moment (index, about me, projects). 
You should probably see it first to understand what I am talking about from here.

Index is the pretty page: it has my name, and links to this github and my insta (since I don't use FB much)

Projects is the fun page: I have a pretty interesting JavaScript running there. I did get the basics of it from this [thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10385950/how-to-get-a-div-to-randomly-move-around-a-page-using-jquery-or-css). Not only do
my project topics move around, once you click on them an overlay turns on.

About me is the obligatory page: It is also the page that inspired my current colour scheme (see pic).

## To-do list: 

- I need to impove the js part
  - Improve the stop button: instead of finishing omving to it's current destination, I need to cut the journey of the object short.
  - Make the script shorter: there are some redundant parts, for example when I init.
- Change the projects page to be less intrusive and in your face
  - Probably by making a normal version with paragraphs, with a big link saying "here is the fun version of the same page"
- About me page
  -I do not like the way the image of me shrinks into the top-right corner when you change the size of the page. 
   - More precisely when your browser screen is approximately square in size.
   - Maybe use bootstrap for this part?
  -Make the text flow better
